## Developing Management Skills Ninth Edition

### Authors: David A. Whetten, Kim S. Cameron

### Introduction

Successful managers are one of the main key indicators of a company's success.

#### What Are Management Skills?

Managements skills are different from general skills as they are:
- behavioural: they consist on actions that lead to positive outcomes. They can be seen from the outside.
- controllable: they are hbehaviours under your control.
- developable: your capacity at using them can improve over time.
- interrelated and overlapping: they work in conjunction with one another.
- contradictory and paradoxical: some of these skills are required to be exerted together, despite being opposite (e.g. being caring and severe).

#### An Approach to Skill Development

A five step learning model will be used:
1. assessment of the skill level and exposure to the behavioural principle
2. presentation of scientifically proven principles for effective skill performance
3. analysis of the application of the principle in an organisational setting
4. immediate practice in the classroom
5. application of the learnt material outside the classroom
